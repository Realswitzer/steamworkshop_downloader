Hi! I'm making a steam workshop add-on downloader using a python script that generates commands and gives them to the steamcmd.exe

On steam, you have the workshop for the games, where you can add add-ons/mods.

I am making a python script that reads a txt containing the add-ons names (one per line), and then generates the commands to give to the `steamcmd.exe` (that can download the add-ons from the workshop, and opens as a normal cmd)

So if I have a `addons.txt` file that looks like this:

> android tiers

And that I give my python script the game's name "Rimworld", my python script returns the following command:

    workshop_download_item 294100 1386412863

Which is made from a str, and two links: the workshop page ID and the addon ID. In this case:

workshop page: https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/

addon page: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1386412863

Then, I have to pass to the steamcmd.exe the following commands. But I don't know how.
I tried searching for os commands, subprocess commands (but I failed).

How could I open the steamcmd.exe, and pass my commands?
